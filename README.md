Driver’s status is crucial because one of the main reasons for motor vehicular accidents is related to driver’s inattention or drowsiness. Drowsiness detector on a car can reduce numerous accidents.Every year, they increase the amounts of deaths and fatalities injuries globally. In this paper, a module for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is presented to reduce the number of accidents due to drivers fatigue and hence increase the transportation safety; this system deals with automatic driver drowsiness detection based on visual information and Artificial Intelligence. We propose an algorithm to locate, track, and analyze both the drivers face and eyes to measure PERCLOS, a scientifically supported measure of drowsiness associated with slow eye closure.Accidents occur because of a single moment of negligence, thus driver monitoring system which works in real-time is necessary. This detector should be deployable to an embedded device and perform at high accuracy. In this project, a novel approach towards real-time drowsiness detection based on deep learning which can be implemented on a low cost embedded board and performs with a high accuracy is proposed. Main contribution of our project is compression of heavy baseline model to a light weight model deployable to an embedded board. Moreover, minimized network structure was designed based on facial landmark input to recognize whether driver is drowsy or not. We will be making a drowsiness detecting device. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.For the detection of drowsiness, the most relevant visual indicators that reflect the driver's condition are the behavior of the eyes, the lateral and frontal assent of the head and the yawn. The system works adequately under natural lighting conditions and no matter the use of driver accessories like glasses, hearing aids or a cap. Due to a large number of traffic accidents when driver has fallen asleep this proposal was developed in order to prevent them by providing a non-invasive system, easy to use and without the necessity of purchasing specialized devices.
